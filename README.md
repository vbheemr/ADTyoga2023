# Yoga Challenge Mobile Application

Welcome to Yoga Challenge Mobile Application.

This document provides an overview of how to install the APK file for Android users, and why direct installation of the IPA file for iOS users isn't feasible. We have an APK file for Android users. Please refer to the respective sections below for more details.

## For Android Users: How to Install APK File

1. Download the APK file from our repository.
2. On your Android device, navigate to your settings and search for the "Install unknown apps" setting. 
3. Enable permission to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.
4. Go to the directory where you've downloaded the APK file.
5. Tap on the APK file, and you will be prompted with a dialog asking for your approval to install the app. 
6. Press "Install", and the installation process will begin.

Please note that the procedure may vary slightly based on your Android version and device manufacturer. 

## For iOS Users:

Unfortunately, direct installation of the IPA file on iOS devices is not possible due to Apple's stringent security protocols. Apple only allows installation of apps through the App Store to ensure the security and integrity of its ecosystem. Sideloading, or the process of installing an app from a source other than the App Store, requires a jailbroken device or a developer account, which may void the warranty or violate the terms of service. 

A Simulator can be used on the Mac Notebook by using the following steps:

1. Download the yoga project from the github.
2. Download the flutter package and install it.
3. Open the Project in any IDE Tool.
4. Open the Terminal and run "open -a simulator"
5. In the IDE tool, run "flutter run"

Thank you!
