# ADTyoga2023 Yoga Theme Mobile Application

Welcome to the README of our Yoga Theme Mobile Application. This document provides an overview of the issues we're currently experiencing, how to install the APK file for Android users, and why direct installation of the IPA file for iOS users isn't feasible. 

## Status Update: Deployment Issue

Due to unforeseen issues with our Mobile Interface, the direct deployment of our Yoga Theme Mobile Application is currently not possible. We're actively working to address this problem and hope to have the app up and running again soon. In the meantime, we have an APK file for Android users and an IPA file for iOS users. However, these files need to be installed explicitly. Please refer to the respective sections below for more details.

## For Android Users: How to Install APK File

1. Download the APK file from our repository.
2. On your Android device, navigate to your settings and search for the "Install unknown apps" setting. 
3. Enable permission to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.
4. Go to the directory where you've downloaded the APK file.
5. Tap on the APK file, and you will be prompted with a dialog asking for your approval to install the app. 
6. Press "Install", and the installation process will begin.

Please note that the procedure may vary slightly based on your Android version and device manufacturer. 

## For iOS Users: Installation of IPA File

Unfortunately, direct installation of the IPA file on iOS devices is not possible due to Apple's stringent security protocols. Apple only allows installation of apps through the App Store to ensure the security and integrity of its ecosystem. Sideloading, or the process of installing an app from a source other than the App Store, requires a jailbroken device or a developer account, which may void the warranty or violate the terms of service. 

We highly advise against attempting to bypass these security measures. Our team is working tirelessly to make the Yoga Theme Mobile Application available through the official App Store as soon as possible.

## Concluding Remarks

We're genuinely grateful for your patience and understanding as we work to rectify the deployment issue. We're dedicated to offering a seamless experience with our Yoga Theme Mobile Application, and we hope to resolve these issues promptly. If you have any queries or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to raise an issue in this repository.

Stay tuned for updates!
